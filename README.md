# Hi 👋, I'm Hasan Mahmud
### A passionate Software Engineer from Bangladesh

I am a Full Stack Developer passionate about modern web technologies such as Angular, React, Node.js, and .NET. I focus on building scalable, high-performance applications while creating seamless and intuitive user experiences. 
Every day, I actively code on .NET, Angular, and build in-house and end-user software solutions, including automation tools, web apps, and API-driven platforms.

I enjoy reading, learning new technologies, exploring ways to improve productivity, and riding my bike to recharge and get inspired.

🌐 I actively contribute to the developer community by mentoring, sharing knowledge, and guiding fellow developers in solving real-world problems.

💡 I’m currently focused on creating educational content for .NET, Angular, and problem-solving in coding, aiming to help others learn efficiently.

🌱 I’m continuously learning — every day is an opportunity to sharpen my skills in software development, freelancing, and entrepreneurship.

🤝 I’m open to remote work, freelancing opportunities, and collaborations that challenge me to grow.
